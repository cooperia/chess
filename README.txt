Thoughts:

- Do checks on the status of positions on the board belong in the Piece/Pawn class? Or should they belong to some sort of board_check module?

- I'm very hung up on white vs dark pieces. Obviously they behave the same in all ways except the direction they travel. This makes for either very long methods in one class to deal with both, or two separate classes... Or some very clever implementation that I haven't come up with. I would love to hear any thoughts you have on that front.
